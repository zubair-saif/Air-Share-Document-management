# Air-Share-Document-management
This project is an online portal for academic documents between students and faculty. This innovative system allows faculty to share important data as well as notifications with students. We propose to build this system on an online server that allows faculty to upload data and students may view search and download required documents. Here students only see and download data of their particular semester. Rest data is hidden. Faculty may access and upload/edit documents to any semester or add any notice as desired.  Faculty operate through pc and document uploading is simpler through a pc, the faculty login is to be performed through a computer. Faculty may upload documents of subject syllabus, timetable document, notifications, e notes etc. through their provided login. The documents are uploaded by faculty to different corresponding departments. When will teacher post something on app then an informative or notification type massage appear on cell phone screen this project is designed for the reducing effort between the both the student and the faculty
